# 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob Minkin  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Master’s student in Statistics with a background in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia SEAS. I’m passionate about combining mathematics, programming, and systems thinking to solve real-world problems in data science, finance, and robotics. I’m currently researching stochastic control, with a focus on price impact, optimal liquidation, and reflected SDEs.

## 🧠 What I Work On  

### 📊 **Data Science & Statistical Modeling**  
I apply statistical and machine learning methods to analyze complex systems and inform real-world decision-making:
- [**NFL Season Simulator (2025)**](https://jacobminkin.github.io/nfl-forecast/): A simulation engine that predicts game outcomes, playoff odds, and team skill scores across the 2025 NFL season.  
- [**NYC Health Inspections**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/NYC_Restaurant_Health_Inspection): Identifying public health trends from restaurant inspection data.  
- [**Housing Price Prediction**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/Predicting_Housing_Prices_NYC): Forecasting NYC housing prices using ML and socioeconomic data.  
- S&P 500 and VIX time series modeling, retail sector trend analysis, and more.

### 🤖 **Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning**  
I'm exploring reinforcement learning and stochastic control as tools for dynamic decision-making:
- [**Machi Koro**](https://github.com/BenMin1/Machi-Koro): Reinforcement learning for optimizing strategy in a board game.  
- [**DiceGame**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/DiceGame): Modeling risk and reward in probabilistic game mechanics.  
- Ongoing projects in market simulation, liquidation strategies, and control of impact-driven processes.

### 🛠️ **Engineering & Robotics**  
My background in mechanical engineering informs my interest in modeling, control, and simulation:
- [**Robot Design & Simulation**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/Robot-Studio-Fall22): CAD-based modeling and control of robotic systems.

## 💻 Tech Stack  
**Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB  
**Libraries & Tools**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Plotly  
**Focus Areas**: Data science, statistical learning, reinforcement learning, quantitative finance, stochastic control, robotics

## 🌟 Let’s Connect  
I’m always excited to collaborate on data-driven projects—especially those involving finance, AI, or systems modeling.
