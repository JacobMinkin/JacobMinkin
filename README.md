# üëã Hi, I'm Jacob Minkin!  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Master's student in Statistics with a background in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). My academic and professional journey reflects my passion for combining mathematics, programming, and problem-solving to tackle real-world challenges.  

## üß† What I Work On  
### **Data Science & Statistics**  
I specialize in analyzing complex datasets and building predictive models, with recent work including reinforcement learning for trading strategy optimization, stochastic modeling, and financial market analysis (e.g., S&P 500, VIX, and retail sector trends).  
- [**Health Inspections in NYC**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/NYC_Restaurant_Health_Inspection): An analysis of NYC restaurant health inspection data to identify patterns and trends affecting public health.  
- [**Predicting Housing Prices in NYC**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/Predicting_Housing_Prices_NYC): A project utilizing machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various socioeconomic factors.  

### **Machine Learning**  
I'm actively exploring machine learning techniques, particularly reinforcement learning, to enhance decision-making processes in finance and beyond.  
- [**Machi Koro**](https://github.com/BenMin1/Machi-Koro): A reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize decision-making in the strategy board game Machi Koro.  
- [**DiceGame**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/DiceGame): A Python-based game demonstrating probabilistic modeling and decision-making strategies.  

### **Robotics & Engineering**  
During my undergraduate studies, I worked on mechanical design, control systems, and robotics projects, applying statistical methods to engineering problems.  
- [**Robot Design and Simulation**](https://github.com/JacobMinkin/Robot-Studio-Fall22): A project showcasing the design and simulation of robotic systems using advanced modeling tools.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming**: Python, R, MATLAB  
- **Tools & Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **Areas of Expertise**: Data analysis, statistical modeling, reinforcement learning, quantitative finance, and robotics  

## üåü Let's Collaborate!  
I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and teams working on impactful projects in data science, finance, or robotics. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out‚Äîlet's create something amazing together!
